<p> As our smoke sesh comes to an end, we said our last goodbyes, as I look at my bland ceilling, I start thinking why? Why am I documenting 
  this? What drove me to it? The only question i can come up with is hope, hope that this sort of blog survives impending doom
  and shows that who should ever come across it. that I didn't tuck my head in between my legs, I lived my last day to the fullest.
