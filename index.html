<p> Waking up around the ripe time of 2:30 pm, what a way to start your final day. Its the year 2085, and after people started sending their trash into outer space, a big mass of garbage is coming to 
  collide with earth. Honestly I dont Know but I felt like documenting my last day. sorry it isnt the most professional looking but given the circumstances I hope you would forgive me.
